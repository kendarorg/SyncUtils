Poor Man's choice
     -h        Help
     -l        Max answer len, between 1 and 99 (default 80)
     -r        Max retry, between 1 and 9 (default 3)
     -s        String to show asking to retry (default "Retry")
     -a        String to show telling that the operation
               aborted (default "Abort")
     -e        Name of the file that will be created containing the variable,
               (default "CHOICE")
     -x        Character to use as an abort sign (default '$')

Batch to load the file into a variable
     @echo off
     cls
     PoorChoice -e TOTAL_CHOICE
     setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
     set CHOICE_VAR=
     for /f "delims=" %%a in (TOTAL_CHOICE) do (
          set currentline=%%a
          set CHOICE_VAR=!%CHOICE_VAR%!currentline!
     )

echo %CHOICE_VAR%

Caveats:
1)   If the file is large, your environment will run out of space and you
     will not be able to place the file's entire contents into your variable.
2)   The above loop will skip any blank lines.
3)   The filecontents variable will still be just a single line, as variables
     can't hold multiple lines.
