totalSynch -f (master dir) -t (slave dir) (-o[parameters]) [-l secondsLeak]
     [+... -p (file pattern)]

     -f        The first directory involved (in case of unidirectional sync,
               this will be the source directory, must follow a directory
     -t        The second directory involved (in case of unidirectional sync,
               this will be the destination directory, must follow a directory
     -l        Maximum difference in seconds allowed for two files to be
               considered modified in the same time (default to 10 seconds)
     -p        The file pattern to blacklist, with the standard * and ?
               syntax (* for any number of any character,? for any single
               character)
     -h        Prints this help

     -o        Options, may be a combination of the following (only once for
               each single sub option):

     Standard sub options:
          v         Verify only modification date and size to check the
                    differences between files
          a         Analyze only, don't make any real modifications but show
                    differences and modifications that will be made
          u         When two files have different dates use the most recent
                    one ignoring the definition of master or slave directory,
                    inhibits the [w] composed sub option;
#         s         Copy data streams (slow, really, you don't want that). If
#                   not working on one NTFS disk and one FAT, the streams are
#                   renamed as [filename.ext]_STR_[streamname.ext].
#                   The rules followed are the one specified in crw options.

     Composed sub options:
          These sub options can be further enriched with the definition of the
          direction of the action everyone of them can be written alone or
          followed by [f] or [t] or [b] that means use the master, the slave
          or both the directories
          c         Copy the new files from the master (default) or following
                    the direction specifications before. Inhibits the [r]
                    option if in contrast (e.g. a [cs] command will inhibit a
                    [rs] command)
          r         Remove the new files from the slave (default)  or following
                    the direction specifications before. Inhibits the [c]
                    option if in contrast
          w         Consider the master as the sole source (default), inhibits
                    the [u] sub option, can't accept the [b] direction, only
                    [f] or [t]
